#Running Code (Test Driven Devleopment)
To run the tests, you need to set up a Python virtual environment on your device. Follow these steps:

Add shell script to permissions chmod +x setup.sh
Run shell script setup.sh to set up the virtual environment and install the required packages.


run: pytest unittests.py 
run: unittests.py


#Scoping
in the tests the follow fixture was added for testing scoping 
in the construction of the interpreter object, the use_lexical_scoping parameter was added to the constructor to allow for testing of the lexical scoping feature.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def interpreter():
    return PostScriptInterpreter(use_lexical_scoping=False)

@pytest.fixture
def interpreter_lexical():
    return PostScriptInterpreter(use_lexical_scoping=True)
```
